Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Last updated: 2025-10-10

Thank you for contributing to aacprocessors-node (“Project”).
This Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”) clarifies how we can use your contributions while you keep your rights.

1. Definitions
	•	“You” means the individual or legal entity submitting a Contribution.
	•	“Contribution” means any original work of authorship (code, docs, tests, sample board files, format-specific fixtures, issues, examples, data, etc.) that you submit to this Project.
	•	“Maintainers” means the Project owners and authorized reviewers.

2. Copyright license

You grant the Maintainers, and recipients of software distributed by the Maintainers, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions and derivative works.

3. Patent license

If you own or control any patent claims that would be infringed by the use, sale, offer for sale, import, or other transfer of your Contribution (alone or with the Project), you grant a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license for those claims to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer your Contribution.
If you (or your agent) initiate patent litigation alleging that the Project or a Contribution infringes a patent, this patent license terminates as of the date litigation is filed.

4. Your representations

By submitting a Contribution, you represent that:
	1.	Originality / rights. The Contribution is your original work, or you have sufficient rights to submit it and to grant the licenses above.
	2.	Third-party material. If the Contribution includes third-party content (code, data, audio, symbols, images), you have identified its source and license, and it is compatible with the Project’s license (currently MIT; see LICENSE). Specifically, Contributions must not include any proprietary, non-redistributable symbol sets (e.g., Boardmaker PCS®) or other media unless you provide explicit proof of a compatible license (e.g., Creative Commons, public domain, or a specific grant of rights).
	3.	No Protected Health Information or Personal Data. The Contribution does not include confidential information, personal data, or Protected Health Information (PHI) you lack the explicit right to share. You represent that any data resembling clinical or user-generated content (including voice recordings, text, or board layouts) is synthetic, fully anonymized, and carries no risk of re-identification.
	4.	No additional restrictions. You will not impose further terms or restrictions on the Contribution (e.g., no additional EULAs or field-of-use limits).
	5.	Compliance. You will follow applicable laws and the Project’s Code of Conduct.

5. Moral rights

To the extent permitted by law, you waive (and agree not to assert) any moral rights you may have in the Contribution against the Maintainers and recipients of the Project, so that we may use, modify, and redistribute it as needed.

6. Notice and attribution

You agree the Maintainers may include a notice attributing you as a contributor in source files, release notes, and acknowledgements, and may reformat or modify your Contribution.

7. Entity contributors

If you submit a Contribution on behalf of an employer or other entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to this Agreement and that the entity agrees to these terms.

8. Disclaimer of warranty

THE PROJECT AND YOUR CONTRIBUTION ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

9. Limitation of liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL YOU OR THE MAINTAINERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS.

10. How you agree to this CLA

You agree to this CLA by any of the following:
	•	Submitting a pull request that includes a DCO-style sign-off line in each commit message, or
	•	Checking the CLA/DCO box presented by any automated check on your pull request, or
	•	Completing and submitting the optional signature block below in your PR.

DCO Sign-off format (required if DCO is enforced):

Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>

11. Relationship to Project license

This Agreement is in addition to the Project’s LICENSE (MIT). Your Contribution will be distributed under the MIT license unless the repository states otherwise.

12. Miscellaneous

If any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect. This Agreement is governed by the laws applicable where the Maintainers are principally based, excluding conflict-of-law rules.

FAQ (project-specific)
	•	Can I include real AAC data?
Please do not. Use synthetic or fully anonymized fixtures. Do not upload identifiable voice/audio or clinical details.
	•	What licenses are acceptable for third-party assets?
MIT/Apache-2.0/BSD-style are preferred for code; ensure data/symbol assets permit redistribution in an open-source project.
	•	Patents?
By contributing, you grant the patent license above. If you file a patent suit alleging infringement by this Project, your patent grant here ends.

This CLA is a community-friendly, Apache-style CLA adapted for AAC libraries. It is not legal advice.
