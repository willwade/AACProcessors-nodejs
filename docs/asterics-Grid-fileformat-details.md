# Asterics Grid File Format Details

This document provides a detailed description of the native file format used by Asterics Grid. This information is intended to help developers create their own parsers and tooling for working with Asterics Grid data.

## 1. Core Concepts

The native Asterics Grid format is fundamentally a collection of JSON objects representing the application's data models. These objects are then encrypted and stored in a database. When exporting, these objects are serialized to a `.grd` file, which is an encrypted JSON file.

The key characteristics of the native format are:

*   **JSON-based:** The underlying structure is built on JSON.
*   **Encrypted:** All data is encrypted using AES encryption (via the `sjcl` library). The stored object is an `EncryptedObject`.
*   **Extensible:** The format is highly extensible and supports a rich set of features not found in the OBF (Open Board Format) standard.

The primary data models are:

*   **`GridData`:** Represents a single grid, including its layout and elements.
*   **`MetaData`:** Stores global user settings and application configuration.
*   **`Dictionary`:** Contains user-defined dictionaries for word prediction.
*   **`EncryptedObject`:** A wrapper object that contains the encrypted data for any of the other models.

## 2. Data Models

This section details the main data models and their properties.

### 2.1. `EncryptedObject`

This is the top-level object that is actually stored in the database.

## 6. Comparison with OBF

While Asterics Grid can import and export files in the Open Board Format (OBF), its native format is significantly more powerful and feature-rich. The OBF export should be considered a "lossy" conversion, as it does not preserve all of the information contained in the native format.

The key features of the native format that are **not** supported by OBF include:

*   **Encryption:** The native format is always encrypted. OBF has no concept of encryption.
*   **Rich Actions:** The vast majority of the `GridAction` types are not part of the OBF standard. OBF primarily supports navigation and simple speech actions. All the advanced actions for interacting with web services, home automation, and other devices are lost when converting to OBF.
*   **Advanced Element Types:** Special element types like `GridElementCollect`, `GridElementLive`, and `GridElementMatrixConversation` are not supported by OBF.
*   **Word Forms:** The concept of word forms does not exist in OBF.
*   **User Dictionaries:** Custom dictionaries for word prediction are not part of the OBF standard.
*   **Global Metadata:** The `MetaData` object, which stores a wide range of user preferences and settings, is not part of the OBF standard.
*   **Multilingual Labels:** While OBF has a `locale` property, the native format's use of a map for translations in labels is more flexible and is not fully preserved in the conversion.
