- **TypeScript** 5.5+ (for development)

---

## üîß Quick Start

### Basic Usage (TypeScript/ES6)

```typescript
import {
  getProcessor,
  DotProcessor,
  SnapProcessor,
  AstericsGridProcessor,
} from "aac-processors";

// Auto-detect processor by file extension
const processor = getProcessor("communication-board.dot");
const tree = processor.loadIntoTree("communication-board.dot");

// Extract all text content
const texts = processor.extractTexts("communication-board.dot");
console.log("Found texts:", texts);

// Direct processor usage
const dotProcessor = new DotProcessor();
const aacTree = dotProcessor.loadIntoTree("examples/example.dot");
console.log("Pages:", Object.keys(aacTree.pages).length);
```

### Basic Usage (CommonJS)

```javascript
const { getProcessor, DotProcessor } = require("aac-processors");

const processor = getProcessor("board.dot");
const tree = processor.loadIntoTree("board.dot");
console.log(tree);
```

### Translation Workflows

All processors support built-in translation via the `processTexts()` method:

```typescript
import { DotProcessor } from "aac-processors";

const processor = new DotProcessor();

// 1. Extract all translatable text
const originalTexts = processor.extractTexts("board.dot");

// 2. Create translation map (integrate with your translation service)
const translations = new Map([
  ["Hello", "Hola"],
  ["Goodbye", "Adi√≥s"],
  ["Food", "Comida"],
]);

// 3. Apply translations and save
const translatedBuffer = processor.processTexts(
  "board.dot",
  translations,
  "board-spanish.dot",
);

console.log("Translation complete!");
```

### Cross-Format Conversion

Convert between any supported AAC formats:

```typescript
import { DotProcessor, ObfProcessor } from "aac-processors";

// Load from DOT format
const dotProcessor = new DotProcessor();
const tree = dotProcessor.loadIntoTree("communication-board.dot");

// Save as OBF format
const obfProcessor = new ObfProcessor();
obfProcessor.saveFromTree(tree, "communication-board.obf");

// The tree structure is preserved across formats
console.log("Conversion complete!");
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Asterics Grid with Audio Support

```typescript
import { AstericsGridProcessor } from "aac-processors";

// Load Asterics Grid file with audio support
const processor = new AstericsGridProcessor({ loadAudio: true });
const tree = processor.loadIntoTree("communication-board.grd");

// Access audio recordings from buttons
tree.traverse((page) => {
  page.buttons.forEach((button) => {
    if (button.audioRecording) {
      console.log(`Button "${button.label}" has audio recording`);
      console.log(
        `Audio data size: ${button.audioRecording.data?.length} bytes`,
      );
    }
  });
});

// Add audio to specific elements
const audioData = Buffer.from(/* your audio data */);
processor.addAudioToElement(
  "board.grd",
  "element-id",
  audioData,
  JSON.stringify({ mimeType: "audio/wav", durationMs: 2000 }),
);

// Create enhanced version with multiple audio recordings
const audioMappings = new Map();
audioMappings.set("element-1", { audioData: audioBuffer1 });
audioMappings.set("element-2", { audioData: audioBuffer2 });
processor.createAudioEnhancedGridFile(
  "source.grd",
  "enhanced.grd",
  audioMappings,
);
```

#### Working with the AACTree Structure

```typescript
import { AACTree, AACPage, AACButton } from "aac-processors";

// Create a communication board programmatically
const tree = new AACTree();

const homePage = new AACPage({
  id: "home",
  name: "Home Page",
  buttons: [],
});

const helloButton = new AACButton({
  id: "btn_hello",
  label: "Hello",
  message: "Hello, how are you?",
  type: "SPEAK",
});

const foodButton = new AACButton({
  id: "btn_food",
  label: "Food",
  message: "I want food",
  type: "NAVIGATE",
  targetPageId: "food_page",
});

homePage.addButton(helloButton);
homePage.addButton(foodButton);
tree.addPage(homePage);

// Save to any format
const processor = new DotProcessor();
processor.saveFromTree(tree, "my-board.dot");
```

#### Error Handling

```typescript
import { DotProcessor } from "aac-processors";

const processor = new DotProcessor();

try {
  const tree = processor.loadIntoTree("potentially-corrupted.dot");
  console.log("Successfully loaded:", Object.keys(tree.pages).length, "pages");
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Failed to load file:", error.message);
  // Processor handles corruption gracefully and provides meaningful errors
}
```

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Extract text from any AAC file
npx aac-processors extract examples/example.dot

# Convert between formats
npx aac-processors convert input.sps output.obf

# Get file information
npx aac-processors info examples/example.gridset
```

## üìö API Reference

### Core Classes

#### `getProcessor(filePathOrExtension: string): BaseProcessor`

Factory function that returns the appropriate processor for a file extension.

```typescript
const processor = getProcessor(".dot"); // Returns DotProcessor
const processor2 = getProcessor("file.obf"); // Returns ObfProcessor
```

#### `BaseProcessor`

Abstract base class for all processors with these key methods:

- `loadIntoTree(filePathOrBuffer: string | Buffer): AACTree` - Load file into tree structure
- `saveFromTree(tree: AACTree, outputPath: string): void` - Save tree to file
- `extractTexts(filePathOrBuffer: string | Buffer): string[]` - Extract all text content

}
```

#### `AACPage`

Represents a single page/screen in a communication board:

```typescript
interface AACPage {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  buttons: AACButton[];
  parentId?: string;

- [ ] **Add mutation testing** - Use Stryker.js for mutation testing
- [ ] **Add benchmark suite** - Performance regression testing
- [ ] **CI/CD improvements** - Add automated releases and npm publishing
- [ ] **Documentation improvements** - Add more real-world examples and tutorials

### Known Issues

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TouchChatProcessor**: Some complex SQLite schemas not fully supported
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Property-based tests**: TypeScript interface mismatches in edge cases
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Memory usage**: Large files (>50MB) may cause memory pressure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Concurrent access**: Some processors not fully thread-safe for simultaneous writes

## More enhancements

- Action types on buttons. We have SPEAK, NAVIGATE, but we could also have things like "PLAY_AUDIO", "SEND_MESSAGE", "OPEN_URL", etc. This would allow us to have a more flexible structure for actions, especially if we want to support different types of actions or additional metadata in the future. This needs to be very flexible. eaach system has a very different set of actions. We could have a set of core actions that are supported by all systems, and then allow each system to define its own additional actions. This could be done by having a set of core action types that are defined in the AACSystem type, and then allowing each system to define its own additional action types in the AACPageSet or AACPage types.
- Styling information for buttons, background colors, and text colors etc
- Current language and locale information of aac pageset
- Symbols and their associated data. Now we have an optional part but I think this might need rethinking. I wonder if "Symbols" should be a separate type - alongside AACPageSet and AACPage. that then AACPageSet and AACPage can reference. This would allow us to have a more flexible structure for symbols, especially if we want to support different types of symbols or additional metadata in the future. Symbols would have: Library name, ID, Text name, Reference (URL, DB ID, etc.), and an optional part for additional metadata. We could have synoynms, antonyms, also and for different languages somehow.
- Somehow we need to deal with access. Switch scanning: Blocks probably being the main aspect. But also - we need to identify somewhere a set of core rules for each aac system. Like for example - what access methods are supported, what languages are supported, what symbols are supported, etc. This could be a set of rules that can be referenced by AACSystem - a different type altogether maybe? It could be in a JSON format maybe. (use case here being for a MCP).
